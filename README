Ticket Manager:
So there must be a million of these in existance so why built another one and fill it with dyslexic spelling.
Well Rails practice mostly, that and the paper note system for my other project was getting more than a Joke.

What this is, is a small rails site with authlogic installed, which gives you Users, Project, Tickets, Comments and Change Logs
Projects can have many users and Users have many Projects.

Tickets have states, active, closed, on hold and invalid as well as either High, Low or Nornal Priorities
Simple Change logs are made on edit of ticket

ATM not all feature are in place but if you are like me in need of quickly creating a list of Jobs then this is for you.  I shall through use continue to improve this.

This is currently hosted on heroku - "blooming-rain-76.heroku.com" and you can just create and account and use it there, but its BETA so I might just wipe all the data on it one day.
